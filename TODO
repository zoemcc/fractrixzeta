implement a lot more loss functions
implement initial travel map via graphs
    propagate player position via the inverse transform
        save pos_mb = transform(pos)
        for i in transforms
            pos_i = inverse_i (pos_mb)
!refactor all the code so that it's a lot more separated (rendering, computation, tests)
!gamestate data structure
    !rendering
    !transforming
    !input
